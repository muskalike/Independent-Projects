  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <p>Currently I am working on building this website through html code and CSS. I have only briefly used it prior. Simultaniosly, I am learning how to wire circuits with an arduino micro-controller. I find that I enjoy teaching myself new technical things. I am Wanting to get into 3D printing as I might just be getting one for christmas. (Bambu Labs A1 mini Combo) As I develop more projects I plan to upload them onto my YouTube channel as a way to document them.</p>

  <script>
    // Fetch navbar.html and insert it into the div with id "navbar"
    fetch('navbar.html')
      .then(response => response.text())
      .then(data => document.getElementById('navbar').innerHTML = data);
  </script>
